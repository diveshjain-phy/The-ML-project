## 1. Face Detection and Recognition System
- Implement a face detection model using OpenCV and a pre-trained Haar Cascade classifier[1][2]
- Extend it to perform face recognition by training on a labeled dataset of faces
- Potential applications in BCI for emotion detection and cyber security for access control systems

## 2. Eye Tracking for BCI 
- Develop a pupil tracking model using OpenCV to detect and track eye movements in real-time[1]
- Integrate with a simple BCI system to map eye movements to computer actions
- Explore more advanced gaze tracking techniques using machine learning models[13]

## 3. EEG Signal Classification
- Use a public EEG signal dataset to train a CNN model to classify mental states[3]
- Preprocess the raw EEG signals and engineer relevant features 
- Evaluate different CNN architectures and hyperparameters to optimize performance

## 4. Deepfake Detection
- Collect a dataset of real and computer-generated fake videos 
- Train a deep learning model to detect subtle artifacts in deepfake videos[5]
- Important application for cyber security to combat disinformation campaigns

## 5. AI-based Firewall using Computer Vision
- Implement an application firewall that uses computer vision to detect and block malicious URLs[5]
- Leverage OCR to extract text from screenshots and match against a database of known phishing sites
- Integrate with browser extensions for real-time protection

## 6. Facial Micro-expression Recognition for BCI
- Build a model to detect and classify facial micro-expressions from video feeds[14]
- Use action units and facial landmarks to extract subtle facial muscle movements 
- Potential to enhance emotion recognition accuracy for BCI applications

By working through these projects, you'll gain practical experience in a range of computer vision techniques relevant to BCI and cyber security, including:

- Classical CV techniques like face detection, eye tracking[1][2]
- Deep learning for classification and object detection[3][5] 
- Datasets spanning images, videos, and biosignals like EEG[3]
- Applications in emotion recognition, deepfake detection, malicious URL blocking[5][14]
